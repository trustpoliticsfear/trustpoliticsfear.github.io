The first generation of Australians born around 9/11 2001 are coming of age. Combining interviews with innovative storytelling workshops in Sydney schools and universities, this project aims to provide the first comparison of the generational and racialized impact of the global 'War on Terror' on Muslim and non-Muslim youth born into a post 9/11 world by focusing on their trust relations, political consciousness and fears.

Part of this project involved writing workshops at schools across Sydney. Writing tasks ranged from ‘stream of consciousness’ style exercises, to narratives written in response to visual and written prompts. The project took youth testimonies seriously, encouraging students to tell their stories on their own terms. The purpose of this website is to offer the students a sense of empowerment by sharing their work with a wider audience and having their stories and views heard and acknowledged.

To protect the anonymity of students and schools who participated in the project, I have assigned pseudonyms to the stories but disclosed the author's age, suburb and religious and ethnic background. These variables have been chosen as this is a comparative project which emerges specifically because the 'Muslim Other' has been the core nexus of concern in the context of the 'War on Terror' and an epoch of global Islamophobia. I am conscious, however, that I am using ‘Muslim’ and ‘non-Muslim’ youth as broad categories. My focus is on Muslims as a racialized collective, not as a faith community per se. Further, my project explores how these racialized collective identities intersect with other layers of identity. Hence, while Muslim/non-Muslim is the primary axis of comparison, I am mindful that other layers of identity and axes of marginalisation, such as ethnicity, gender, class, geography etc, intersect with this core focus.
