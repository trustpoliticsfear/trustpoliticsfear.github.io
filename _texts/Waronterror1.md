## anoymous, 17, female, Parramatta

Ever since I was born I have grown up with terrorism and extremist ideologies that have surrounded the political and social climate I'm currently in today. The first thing I hear in the morning, terrorist attack, gun shooting, Trump, and airstrikes on Syria. A climate of fear perpetuated amongst not just the older, but the younger generations. It has created a climate that has stunted growth and progress. As a 16-year-old young male, I often question what can I do to change? But what I can only do is work on myself and immediate people I'm physically connected to. And what I can do about the other seven billion in the world? The harsh reality is that I can't, but the leaders of the world can, yet they don't. When they enter politics, they enter for the wrong reasons, and this has generated a climate of unrealistic, illogical disastrous and irresponsible decision making.
