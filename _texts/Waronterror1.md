## Manuel, 17, male, Parramatta, Filipino Australian, Roman Catholic

Ever since I was born I have grown up with terrorism and extremist ideologies that have surrounded the political and social climate I'm currently in today. The first thing I hear in the morning, terrorist attack, gun shooting, Trump, and airstrikes on Syria. A climate of fear perpetuated amongst not just the older, but the younger generations. It has created a climate that has stunted growth and progress. As a 16-year-old young male, I often question what can I do to change? But what I can only do is work on myself and immediate people I'm physically connected to. And what I can do about the other seven billion in the world? The harsh reality is that I can't, but the leaders of the world can, yet they don't. When they enter politics, they enter for the wrong reasons, and this has generated a climate of unrealistic, illogical disastrous and irresponsible decision making. What example have these people set for the younger generation, the future of Australia? Only one built on the instigation of fear, abuse of power, and this has lead to world destruction.

Growing up requires positive influences, people I can look up to. As one who is personally passionate about law, politics, current affairs, and social issues, not seeing much being done places a massive pressure with the example I am given in differentiation to the example I must follow. With a desire and passion for change and not seeing any, what can I do? The gap one, which needs to be closed, yet the prices of reconciliation is so stagnant. While our own national anthem promotes for those who come across the seas with boundless plains to share, and you see the opposite goes to show how authentic our leaders are. Racism, persecution, discrimination. Could we honestly imagine that these are products of humanity? The desire of the heart really aims for hatred, violence? It's a sad truth, but this is the world I have grown up in.

The war and terror means sadness and death, separation of families. It is mentally and physically draining to know that we are killing each other for no good or convincing reason. One reason people seem to give is mainly due to race and certain beliefs people have that everyone questions. We're all humans. We were all created by the same being. Why not just get along? Why is it so hard for people to learn that the world doesn't revolve around one person who thinks they are any better than anyone else or one gender being of higher power. I am sick and tired of listening to politicians pretend that they're doing better when we'd be better off dead than having this one ignorant person making us great again when it's been the best since ever. I'm sick of us separating [inaudible 00:44:06]. I'm sick of people in power, making idiotic choices that make everything worse. I'm sick of racism that is displayed every damn day.

## Bailey, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, agnostic

We're facing a triple threat of terrorism, false fear and disorder. The false information in our society all makes a contribution to the spreading of fear. I think that if I were Muslim, I would feel very sad about the conflict between Muslims and others, but I think Muslim people should be responsible for their own actions, and it doesn't mean all Muslims are in the way to be judged. I would feel sad for the person who has been murdered and I would hope that people don't get involved in conflicts anymore.

## Monica, 17, female, North West Sydney, Indian Australian, Christian

2001, the year I was born, but also the year that sparked chaos and trauma that is talked about until this day. One word: scared. Growing up at the dawn of the 21st century, my generation was born, but of a world of fear from the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the consequences today- war in the Middle East and beyond. Specifically as an Australian teen, how do I find the correct perspective on today's political and social climate in the shadows of fear and in mistrust? News, fake news, politicians, liars. Your minority friends, so called terrorists. Being born into this, I have never known any different, however it was once said, "The one thing we learn about history is that we don't learn from history." The tension in the political climate has caused a sense of fear and separation of the world and it is through this ignorance that ideologies such as Nazism have returned sharing similarities to 1940s Germany. Figures such as Donald Trump have shaped a world view, challenging ideas on a social level of the importance of relationships, shifting American towards a form of nationalism. This worries me as an Australian 17-year-old teen from Sydney as the greatest threat that actually challenges us is the wellbeing of the planet and the spread of fake news and denial which has divided the world.

## May, 17, female,  South Wentworthville, Anglo Australian, Anglican.

Fake news warps the minds of our citizens. Our wave of information changes into an era of misinformation. I feel a lack of hope in our political world. Five prime minsters in less than 10 years. It really shows the change that our politicians are making. The war on terror desensitizes us, polarizes the world. Steals instead of uniting it. Is the change in our political and social lives a positive one? Will we improve it or remain passive?

The power of priorities, if you understand someone’s priorities you can understand their actions. Yet with the recent sensationalization of Muslim extremism it’s hard not to wonder why this trend of blame exists. Everyone has  an agenda. As much as it may surprise you, media and politicians lie, the various examples of political persuasion that could almost spill into the ballpark of propaganda is… extreme. Understanding this trend requires perspective, why would those dedicated to providing us with the truth, lie to us? Taking an objective step back allows for a window of clarity, what do the media and politicians want? What are their priorities?

Politicians are driven by the power in democracy, their priority is gaining the populus’ trust and votes, when considering that does it not make sense that politics would revolve around controversial subjects and creating common cause. Through the use of blame and associating words such as Islam and terrorism together, politicians create a common enemy which motivates voters to elect a representative who is combatting this common enemy who is a danger to our society.

We can resolve a similar theme in the media, the idea of ratings and increasingly important value of viewer’s attention being the media priority and their source of capital and power creates yet another window of clarity through which we can understand the inclination of the media to crucify and sensationalize a community with causing discomfort or enforcing change from the audience. By creating a story that a nation already believes and solidifying it with such intensity that anything to the contrary of this narrative is drowned by the passive nature of an audience that is acclimatised to increasingly sensationalized and narrow perspective and find discomfort in ideas of ideological change.
