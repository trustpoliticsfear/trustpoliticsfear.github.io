Instruction: Write a TED talk - a personal speech about what it feels like growing up in today’s global political and social climate

## Manuel, 17, male, Blacktown

We live in an evolving world. A world rapidly transforming in front of our eyes, before even our minds can account for and take in the change that is occuring. The social construct of gender has been present for as long as humanity can remember. Though at times stereotypical, these gender norms and gender roles have survived the test of time because of their significance in the function of a successful society.

Nations around the world have considered the removal of the specification of gender on birth certificates and passports, claiming that it is up to the child to decide their own gender, out of the 3000 that appear to exist. It is not long until...or perhaps we are already in the midst of creating memes depicting the saying, “Only 90s kids will remember” situated above the two symbols of the male and female.

Eradication of gender and the fluidity of it may disrupt the dynamics of our society. Will it be considered rude ask a parent the gender of their child? Or assume its gender according the colour of clothing? Will the classification of gender for a teenager be considered a rite of passage, similar to receiving your P plate? Could it possibly be a crime to address another individual by the incorrect pronoun, confronted by fines and the loss of demerit points?
