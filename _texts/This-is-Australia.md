The prompt given to students was to make a poem modelled on [This is America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY) by Childish Gambino. The sample below are from students who participated in writing workshops in Western and North West Sydney. The workshops were conducted at schools and a local library in Western Sydney.

- This is Australia
- A land of the flannies and thongs
- We're getting too many 'chongs'

- As if he fucking cares.

- Or was it Mabo or Wik now?
- Look what we're feeling now?

## Aisha, 17, female, Greenacre, Afghan Australian, Muslims
