The prompt given to students was to make a poem modeled on [This is America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY) by Childish Gambino. 

## Manuel, 17, male, Blacktown

- We just want a house
- A cheap home for you
- Someone pass the beer
- And the ciggie too
- All the wogs are here
- They gon' trash the loo
- This is Australia
- We're multicultural
- And we're so sociable
- Lockout laws all 'atrociable'
- This is Australia
- Politics are bloody mess
- 10 Years, 5 PMs, no less
- Western Sydney, we here, FINESSE

 

## Luke, 17, Blacktown, Australian, Catholic, 

- This is Australia,
- Don't be persuaded by our national song.
- History is a 'funny' thing it must go on.
- Yet the dispossessed many
- Or the privileged, if any. 
- Have a different story to tell.
- Is it white Australia? Or our Australia?
- Was it Watson or Reid now?
- Or was it Mabo or Wik now?
- Look what we're feeling now?
