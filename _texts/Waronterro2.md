Growing up requires positive influences, people I can look up to. As one who is personally passionate about law, politics, current affairs, and social issues, not seeing much being done places a massive pressure with the example I am given in differentiation to the example I must follow. With a desire and passion for change and not seeing any, what can I do? The gap one, which needs to be closed, yet the prices of reconciliation is so stagnant. While our own national anthem promotes for those who come across the seas with boundless plains to share, and you see the opposite goes to show how authentic our leaders are. Racism, persecution, discrimination. Could we honestly imagine that these are products of humanity? The desire of the heart really aims for hatred, violence? It's a sad truth, but this is the world I have grown up in.
