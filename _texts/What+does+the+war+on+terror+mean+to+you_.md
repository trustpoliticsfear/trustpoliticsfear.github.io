When I hear about a terrorist incident in a Western country, I feel disappointed in the acts of humanity, regardless of the terrorist’s background. When I hear politicians telling the Muslim community to take responsibility I think that it is extremely racist and rude to do so. When I’m going through airport security I wonder, ‘Will anyone here actually cause harm?’. When I go on social media for the latest news I feel that I have a constant need to filter through biased articles and media companies that are not credible. When I think about the world I will inherit, I hope that the future will be much brighter and that society will manage to come together in order to prevent these acts of terrorism. When I think about my place in the world I realise how minuscule my problems are in comparison to issues around the globe.
