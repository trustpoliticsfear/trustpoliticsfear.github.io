## Student were asked to write a reflection on how they feel about the world they're growing up in particularly in the context of being born closely before or after 9/11 2001.

## Danielle, 17, female, Blacktown, Anglo Australian, no religion

The world we currently live in is full of white sheep, that cannibalise the black sheep minority willing to speak and make a difference. We are merely bandwagoners that don’t put the effort into swiping and searching for news at the bottom of a melting iceberg, and only scrape the surface of irrelevant celebrity news.
> - {:.indent-1} We only care about politics, and society’s problems, when it’s too late to hear the warnings and they've already affected the society that WE live in because our generation today says “It’s all about me and now”. Do we really care when we’re posting apologetic pictures about terror and social and political trauma, or is it merely about grabbing likes and compliments and validations?
> - {:.indent-1} We continue afterwards scrolling through pictures of puppies, memes, food posts, and never speak of our social and political problems again, until it happens again and a reaction is expected to 'prove' we care.  

## Drake, 17, male, Mount Druitt, Anglo Australian, Christian

To me the war on terror means a disagreement between religions. From what I know and see, it's a war between Muslims, extremists, and westerners. Personally, I know not all Muslims are extremists. Most of them aren't, but there are groups out there that thrive on terrorist attacks. I don't know why there are these groups and why they do what they do, but I feel restricted in everything I do and say now. When traveling, it is a very long and exhausting process with customs and security, but I know it's for all our protection.
I feel that these acts of terrorism make us hate Muslims because that's what we see on the news, but it's not all of them that we should hate. In fact, we shouldn't hate any of them because being loving is always better. If only everyone is loving.

## Jade, 17, female, Liverpool, Anglo Australian, Anglican

The war on terror is just a background to my life. I don't feel I can really define it because I haven't known anything else and therefore I have nothing to compare it to. I don't know much about it. It rarely comes up as a topic of conversation, and my family aren't very outspoken on their political views. They are neutral on most political matters. That is, they don't have any extreme views. As far as I am aware, the war on terror only enters my life through media. For example, news reports, television, rarely on social media, attacks overseas, et cetera. I feel ignorant to the matter compared to what I feel I should know about it. I am not ignorant enough, however, to blame a whole nation or religion for the actions of extremist groups.

## Leo, 17, male, Fairfield, Italian Australian, Catholic

I think the war on terror is a global issue that is overshadowing other world issues due to never-ending attention to it. It needs to stop. Terrorism ruins our world and I don't want my future kids growing up with the fear of terrorism. The attention to terrorism has made the world a safer place, as in all parts of the world. Laws advanced attention and protection to it. For example, the FBI, Interpol. However, figures such as Pauline Hanson and Trump must stop creating protests and laws banning Muslim people, or else it will never stop.

## Madison, 16, female, Stanhope Gardens, Anglo Australian, no religion

I haven't known a world where there wasn't any terrorism. Knowing what is going on has made me more aware of the world and oblivious to my surroundings, because you'd never know what could happen, and when anything could happen. It means that we've always been a world where people have to live in fear because of this continuous cycle.

## Theresa, 17, female, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, religion not stated

When I was in middle school, a middle teacher that also became a friend, who I'll remember for life, for years, left such a significant impact on me. My friends and I were 13 when we were introduced to the Syrian war that has been going on. We had very little knowledge on the political side of the war, but as we were taught about the things that were going on there, we were drawn to it. My best friend and I would talk about it every day. In school, in class, on the soccer field. Whenever and wherever. It wasn't an overtly political discussion because as innocent as we were, our main concern was the children and civilians of Syria. With the discussion with our teacher, we came up with a plan to help them, and yes, that's how dedicated we were in helping those innocent people, that we spent countless recesses and free time to record videos so we could raise money in order to donate to them. As children born in a peaceful country that keeps us safe. We were not exposed to the war on terror, but I was glad how my teacher of that year exposed us to the idea of it, allowing us to do the very little we can to provide help.
The war on terror means a war that we all should fight for no matter how much you contribute to it, or at least that's what it meant to my naïve heart when I was 13, because I'm afraid as time goes on, our hearts would become numb to such things. Not because there is a decay in morality, but because the constant overwhelming war on terror will probably remain relevant for a long time.


## Haley, 17, female, Penant Hills, Anglo Australian, Jewish

I feel like for people in my generation, the war terror has kind of just been in the background of our lives. We learned about all the different wars and conflicts in school and we hear about them in the news, but I feel like it has unfortunately become a normal thing. I think because we see it so often and hear about it, we have, as a generation, become immune to the sadness and grief that we all should actually feel. For example, when I see something in the news about an attack or a murder, it's bad, but I feel that the automatic internal reaction is, damn, that sucks, and then you go on living your life without thinking about it again. Also, another thing is that you become really selective about what you feel sadness for. What I mean is that, for example, with the Ariana Grande concert bombing, I feel like there wasn't enough people paying attention to the victims.

## Jess, 17, female, Castle Hill, Anglo-Chinese Australian, Christian

I think anger is productive. It’s what changes society. But growing up in today’s day and age I still don’t know what I’m angry about. I’m still figuring it out.

## Caleb, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, atheist
I don't really think about or really care about the war on terror since it has never effected me. I like to mind my own business and let the world sort itself out.

## Harry, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, Anglican
Growing up today I'm afraid of the potential racism has to escalate from verbal discrimination to violence and war in Australia. I'm embarrassed by my failures in comparison to others. I'm good at debating and public speaking. I'm bad at sport. I'm conflicted by the desire to succeed and to enjoy life now. I'm not powerless just because I'm young.

## Toby, 16, male, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, Christian

It doesn't affect my day to day life. Islamophobia is a result. I can see that for Muslims. People don't care as much as they should.

## Zak, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, Christian

The war on terror seems like a thing far away from me.

## Shay, 17, female, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, no religion

The war on terror means nothing to me. I don't think about it and I don't care.

## Kylie, 17, female, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, Christian

The war on terror is just in the background. It's not my daily life. It's far away from me.

## Julia, 17, female, Parramatta, Green-Australian, Orthodox

Although the war on terror has not directly affected me, I know how alert people are towards threats and racism towards many people. I was going towards Martin Place on the day of the Lindt Café siege because I had to perform at Angel Place. The performance was quickly cancelled and we had to go on to the internet to check what was happening. Apart from that, the war on terror hasn't affected me. I have no memory of 9/11, but my parents have told me about it.

## Tim, 17, male, North West Sydney, American-Australian, no religion

I'm a little surprised by how unaffected I am by the war on terror. How normal it is. People who have become desensitized towards it, normalizing the issue in our life.

## Simone, 17, female, North West Sydney, American-Australian, no religion

Some say that it is a thing that requires attention, but it's not a large part of my life. I think that it is important to not focus on terror too much as it's a feeling that will induce stress.  

## Megan, 17, female, North West Sydney, Anglo-Australian, agnostic

The war on terror doesn't directly affect us. It saddens me to see a terror attack happen, what seems like every week now. It's like it is the norm. When I am at large events, it's always at the back of my mind at the start. Something needs to be done, but we as students can't help.  

## Josh, 17, male, Merrylands, Anglo-Australian, no religion

The war on terror doesn't affect me personally, but obviously affects people of Islamic and Muslim background. This is evident with discrimination seen through the media.

## David, 16, male, Dural, Italian-Australian, Christian

I do not notice any effects of the war on terror on my life, although there may be things that are influenced by the war on terror, like increased security at airports. However, I've always grown up in this world where that was a normal. I've never associated those things with stopping terrorism but merely was stopping criminals or just people who are bad and willing to be violent. At a concert I went to, I notice the security checks and was thinking about it with regards to someone bombing the concert or an enacting another act of violence, but this was merely a passing thought and I did not feel any sort of fear about it. I think this is because I've never felt the personal effects of terrorism, so it seems like background noise in my life and things that just happened in the background. Something that just exists.

## Margaret, 16, female, Castle Hill, Anglo-Australian, Christian

When I think of the war on terror, I think of all the events that have been heavily publicized by the media and that is the only way I know about them. I never consciously seek out more information about what happened or how I could help. Only feeling sorry for the people affected, then moving on. I'm not particularly proud of this, but I think for my generation, all the focuses on your education and jumping on opportunities to better your future and occupation.

## Susan, 18, female, Penant Hills, Anglo-Australian, no religion

When it comes to the war on terror, I'm kind of ignorant to be honest. People talk on the news, on social media, but that never really felt personal to me. Sure, it's happening and it's terrible, but because I'm lucky enough to not have encountered any of this personally or through family, it's horrible to say, but it's just news. I don't know how I can help fix this or the full extent of it because, again, the media plays it down or doesn't show you everything or allow you to understand the whole situation. So yes, things are happening around me, but I've grown up with it so it doesn't have as big an impact as it should. It's almost normal.

## Manuel, 17, male, Parramatta, Filipino Australian, Roman Catholic

Ever since I was born I have grown up with terrorism and extremist ideologies that have surrounded the political and social climate I'm currently in today. The first thing I hear in the morning, terrorist attack, gun shooting, Trump, and airstrikes on Syria. A climate of fear perpetuated amongst not just the older, but the younger generations. It has created a climate that has stunted growth and progress. As a 16-year-old young male, I often question what can I do to change? But what I can only do is work on myself and immediate people I'm physically connected to. And what I can do about the other seven billion in the world? The harsh reality is that I can't, but the leaders of the world can, yet they don't. When they enter politics, they enter for the wrong reasons, and this has generated a climate of unrealistic, illogical disastrous and irresponsible decision making. What example have these people set for the younger generation, the future of Australia? Only one built on the instigation of fear, abuse of power, and this has lead to world destruction.


## Dia, 17, male, Merrylands, Lebanese Australian, Catholic

Growing up requires positive influences, people I can look up to. As one who is personally passionate about law, politics, current affairs, and social issues, not seeing much being done places a massive pressure with the example I am given in differentiation to the example I must follow. With a desire and passion for change and not seeing any, what can I do? The gap one, which needs to be closed, yet the prices of reconciliation is so stagnant. While our own national anthem promotes for those who come across the seas with boundless plains to share, and you see the opposite goes to show how authentic our leaders are. Racism, persecution, discrimination. Could we honestly imagine that these are products of humanity? The desire of the heart really aims for hatred, violence? It's a sad truth, but this is the world I have grown up in.

## Georgia, 17, female, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, Christian

The war and terror means sadness and death, separation of families. It is mentally and physically draining to know that we are killing each other for no good or convincing reason. One reason people seem to give is mainly due to race and certain beliefs people have that everyone questions. We're all humans. We were all created by the same being. Why not just get along? Why is it so hard for people to learn that the world doesn't revolve around one person who thinks they are any better than anyone else or one gender being of higher power. I am sick and tired of listening to politicians pretend that they're doing better when we'd be better off dead than having this one ignorant person making us great again when it's been the best since ever. I'm sick of us separating [inaudible 00:44:06]. I'm sick of people in power, making idiotic choices that make everything worse. I'm sick of racism that is displayed every damn day.

## Bailey, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, agnostic

We're facing a triple threat of terrorism, false fear and disorder. The false information in our society all makes a contribution to the spreading of fear. I think that if I were Muslim, I would feel very sad about the conflict between Muslims and others, but I think Muslim people should be responsible for their own actions, and it doesn't mean all Muslims are in the way to be judged. I would feel sad for the person who has been murdered and I would hope that people don't get involved in conflicts anymore.

## Monica, 17, female, North West Sydney, Indian Australian, Christian

2001, the year I was born, but also the year that sparked chaos and trauma that is talked about until this day. One word: scared. Growing up at the dawn of the 21st century, my generation was born, but of a world of fear from the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the consequences today- war in the Middle East and beyond. Specifically as an Australian teen, how do I find the correct perspective on today's political and social climate in the shadows of fear and in mistrust? News, fake news, politicians, liars. Your minority friends, so called terrorists. Being born into this, I have never known any different, however it was once said, "The one thing we learn about history is that we don't learn from history." The tension in the political climate has caused a sense of fear and separation of the world and it is through this ignorance that ideologies such as Nazism have returned sharing similarities to 1940s Germany. Figures such as Donald Trump have shaped a world view, challenging ideas on a social level of the importance of relationships, shifting American towards a form of nationalism. This worries me as an Australian 17-year-old teen from Sydney as the greatest threat that actually challenges us is the wellbeing of the planet and the spread of fake news and denial which has divided the world.

## May, 17, female,  South Wentworthville, Anglo Australian, Anglican.

Fake news warps the minds of our citizens. Our wave of information changes into an era of misinformation. I feel a lack of hope in our political world. Five prime minsters in less than 10 years. It really shows the change that our politicians are making. The war on terror desensitizes us, polarizes the world. Steals instead of uniting it. Is the change in our political and social lives a positive one? Will we improve it or remain passive?


## 17, male, Parramatta, Persian Australian, agnostic

> - {:.indent-1} The power of priorities. If you understand someone’s priorities you can understand their actions. Yet with the recent sensationalization of Muslim extremism it’s hard not to wonder why this trend of blame exists. Everyone has  an agenda. As much as it may surprise some, media and politicians lie, the various examples of political persuasion that could almost spill into the ballpark of propaganda is… extreme. Understanding this trend requires perspective: why would those dedicated to providing us with the truth, lie to us? Taking an objective step back allows for a window of clarity. What do the media and politicians want? What are their priorities?
> - {:.indent-1} Politicians are driven in democracy by their priority of gaining the populous’ trust and votes. So it makes sense that politics would revolve around controversial subjects and creating a common cause that gains the most votes. Through the use of blame and associating words such as Islam and terrorism together, politicians create a common enemy which motivates voters to elect a representative who is combatting this common enemy who is apparently a danger to our society.
> - {:.indent-1} The same priority applies to the media. Instead of votes- ratings. This explains some media's drive to crucify and sensationalize a community. By creating a story that a nation already believes in and solidifying it with such intensity that anything to the contrary of this narrative is drowned out. Drowned out by a passive audience  acclimatised to increasingly sensationalized and narrow perspectives. Drowned out by a fearful audience, uncomfortable with change.


## Amy, 16, female, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, no religion

Terrorism is never an accident. Terrorism is a crime. Terrorists are not a ‘sort’ of people. So why does the volume of the television always reverberate louder than the gunshots across the street?


## Reem, 17, female, North West Sydney, African Australian, Christian

I am loyal. I am self conscious. I am bold. I am judgmental. I am unforgiving. I was born on 11 June, 2001. I don't remember there ever being a time where the attitudes throughout society have been different, although, around the time after attacks or particular events in Sydney, people, particularly parents, become hyper aware of danger. I also am an immigrant, and it's just the culture where I'm from to be aware of danger. Windows always closed in the car. Blinds are closed if we aren't home. Lights are on if we aren't home to deter thieves. They're always just things that I have known and done to protect myself and be aware of my surroundings. I also have been taught by my parents to not believe everything that is told by the media, as it's used for propaganda. I wonder about who's liberation is more important. I wonder about the manipulation of children. I wonder about the difference between first world freedom versus third world freedom.


## Blake, 17, male, North West Sydney, Anglo Australian, no religion

Combating terrorism is very important, as many innocent people die. But it's rude that all Muslims are often assumed to be radicals and have to face racism as a result. The war on terror doesn't really affect me personally, but obviously it's still important. It makes me sad. Unable to comprehend when fear makes people aggressively racist towards Muslims. How can people be so ignorant and horrible?

## Jasmine, 16, female, North West Sydney, Anglo/Chinese Australian, Buddhist

The war on terror. It's scary. It's scary to think I can't go overseas or anywhere, in fact, without always thinking about all the what ifs. *What if there is an attack? What if this is the last time I ever seen my family and my dogs? What if I die when I come out of a concert or a footy game?* It's weird to think that there was a time when most people didn't even know what terrorism was. It's sad that this is what the world is like now. There will always be that what if, but we can't let this stop us from living our lives because that risk will always be there. We need to live our lives as we would if terrorism wasn't a thing, because if we're always scared and never go anywhere, that means the terrorists win and we can't let them claim any more innocent lives.
