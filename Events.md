## Panel at Macquarie University 3 April 2019: 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' Navigating anti-racism, academia and advocacy as a person of colour today

Prompted by interviews for high school and university students on the subject of politics and activism in today's social and political environment, I organised a panel discussion at Macquarie University on 3 April 2019. The event was chaired by Dr Alana Lentin, President of the Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association (ACRWSA).

A recording of the event is available here:  [https://echo360.org.au/media/7b61a4c4-f056-4518-a313-6fc66af0755b/public](https://echo360.org.au/media/7b61a4c4-f056-4518-a313-6fc66af0755b/public)

## Event blurb:

Anti-racism is often dismissed as political correctness or identity politics. To speak out and act against racism is to attract accusations of 'playing the race card' or 'shutting down free speech'. At a time when collective mobilization that makes demands on the state is delegitimized in favour of individualised activism that celebrates racial illiteracy, academics and activists are challenged to build new modes of participation, activism and political communities. What are the stakes, the threats, the challenges, the lessons, the hopes and goals of anti-racism work today? In this panel discussion, academics and activists reflect on their experiences of 'speaking out' against racism and injustice.
